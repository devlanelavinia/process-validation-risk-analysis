# Process Validation and Risk Analysis

## Problem
Operational processes that rely on manual data handling are prone to silent failures, inconsistencies, and validation gaps that can compromise decision-making.

## Objective
Design a simple validation layer to detect inconsistencies, missing data, and high-risk scenarios in an operational data flow.

## Approach
Map the process flow, identify critical validation points, and implement lightweight automation to flag potential failures before they propagate.

## Risk & Failure Points
- Missing or inconsistent inputs
- Manual data manipulation
- Lack of validation rules
- Silent error propagation

## Validation Logic
Rule-based checks applied to input data to ensure completeness, consistency, and logical integrity.

## Trade-offs
This project prioritizes clarity and reliability over performance and scale.
